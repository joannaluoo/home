		<h2>Color Psychology</h2>
		<p>Different colors can evoke different feelings in people. Of course a color doesn&rsquo;t always evoke the same feeling in different people,  
		as personal experiences influence your opinion on a color, but colors often evoke similar feelings in people, which is how brands 
		use colors to attract their audience. You can apply color psychology in art and design by choosing specific colors for your piece 
		that will set a specific mood for it, and evoke specific feelings in the person looking at it. </p>
