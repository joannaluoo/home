		<h2>Color Context</h2>
		<p>Colors look different depending on the other colors surrounding them. This is a very important part of using colors in art&sbquo; 
		because it plays a big part in making the illusion of lighting in a flat piece. Color context can trick our brain into thinking that
		a color looks more saturated&sbquo; dark&sbquo; bright&sbquo; etc. by just the colors around it. A color could look completely different in one piece than 
		another. If you look at a picture of a dimly lit object&sbquo; it will still seem like the same color as a picture of a brightly lit 
		object would&sbquo; because the colors surrounding the object would also be darker&sbquo; or less saturated in the dimly lit photo. But when 
		you would actually compare the 2 colors&sbquo; one would be a lot darker. In the images below&sbquo; it is the same grey square on two different 
		color backgrounds&sbquo; making one stand out more. This is an example of how a color stands out more when it is next to a color that is a lot 
		different than itself&sbquo; than if it was next to a similar color of similar saturation&sbquo; hue&sbquo; etc.</p>

		<p>Another example of color context is the picture below. It is just a picture of a plain white wall. Well&sbquo; it looks white&sbquo; but it&rsquo;s not. 
		Once you compare it to actual white&sbquo; you can see that it is actually a lot darker. But if I were to ask someone what color the wall was&sbquo; 
		they would most likely say white. This also shows how an object in real life isnt just one pure color&sbquo; and is made up of tons of different 
		colors that make it look the way it is. </p>
