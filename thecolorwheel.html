		<h2>The Color Wheel</h2>
		
		<h3>What Is It?</h3>
		<p>The color Wheel is a very important part of color theory. It was invented by Isaac Newton in 1666, and it&rsquo;s just the color spectrum arranged on 
		a circle. It shows the relationships between the different colors. It is used by artists and designers to decide which colors would look good together, 
		which is called color harmony. By using color combinations, you can find color harmonies. Color combinations are determined by their relative positions 
		in the color wheel to each other, and are used to find colors that look pleasant together. There are different types of color wheels for different mediums, 
		for example printing uses CMYK, which uses the primary colors cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. The one shown below, however, is the RYB color wheel that 
		most people learned about in school, which has red, yellow, and blue as primary colors. </p>

		<h3>Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Colors</h3>
		<h4>Primary colors</h4>
		<p>Primary colors are situated a third of the wheel apart from each other on the wheel, so they are the same amount of distance apart. They are colors that 
		cannot be mixed from other colors. For the RYB color wheel, they are red, yellow, and blue, and they are subtractive primary colors, meaning that they get darker 
		when mixed together. </p>

		<h4>secondary colors</h4>
		<p>Secondary colors are colors that form when primary colors are mixed together. On the RGB color wheel, these would be orange, green, and purple. </p>
		<h4>tertiary colors</h4>
		<p>Tertiary colors are made from mixing a primary and secondary color together. On the RGB color wheel, these colors would include teal, violet, and magenta. 
		<h3>Color Temperature</h3>
		<p>Colors can be either warm or cool. The way colors are placed on the color wheel also indicate if they are a warm or a cool color. Warm colors are on 
		one side of the color wheel while cool colors are on the other side. As you can see below, warm colors include red, orange and yellow, and cool 
		colors include green, blue, and purple. </p>

		<h3>Color Schemes</h3>
		<p>Color Schemes are color combinations that look appealing together. Below are the seven main color schemes.

		<h3>Tints, Shades, and  tones</h3>
		<ul class="reglist">
			<li>Tint: How much white is in the color</li>
			<li>Shade: How much black is in the color</li>
			<li>Tone: How much grey is in the color </li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Saturation and Hue</h3>
		<h4>Hue</h4>
		<p>Hue is the dominant color family of a color. It&rsquo;s basically just pure color, and what we use the color wheel to choose. For example a hue would 
		be green, without any shade, tone, or tint.</p>
		<h4>Saturation</h4>
		<p>Saturation is essentially the intensity of a color. A color that has no saturation would be either black, grey, or white. Below is 
		an example of different saturations. They are 2 of the same images, only the right one is more saturated than the left.</p>
