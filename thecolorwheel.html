		<h2>The Color Wheel</h2>
		
		<h3>What Is It?</h3>
		<p>The color Wheel is a very important part of color theory. It was invented by Isaac Newton in 1666&sbquo; and is just the color spectrum arranged on 
		a circle. It shows the relationships between the different colors. It is used by artists and designers to decide which colors would look good together&sbquo; 
		which is called color harmony. By using color combinations&sbquo; you can find color harmonies. Color combinations are determined by their relative positions 
		in the color wheel to each other&sbquo; and are used to find colors that look pleasant together. There are different types of color wheels for different mediums&sbquo; 
		for example printing uses CMYK&sbquo; which uses the primary colors cyan&sbquo; magenta&sbquo; yellow&sbquo; and black. The one shown below&sbquo; however&sbquo; is the RYB color wheel that 
		most people learned about in school&sbquo; which has red&sbquo; yellow&sbquo; and blue as primary colors. </p>

		<h3>Primary&sbquo; Secondary&sbquo; and Tertiary Colors</h3>
		<h4>Primary colors</h4>
		<p>Primary colors are situated a third of the wheel apart from each other on the wheel&sbquo; so they are the same amount of distance apart. They are colors that 
		cannot be mixed from other colors&sbquo; For the RYB color wheel&sbquo; They are Red&sbquo; Yellow&sbquo; and Blue&sbquo; and they are subtractive primary colors&sbquo; meaning that they get darker 
		when mixed together. </p>

		<h4>secondary colors</h4>
		<p>Secondary colors are colors that form when primary colors are mixed together. On the RGB color wheel&sbquo; these would be orange&sbquo; green&sbquo; and purple. </p>
		<h4>tertiary colors</h4>
		<p>Tertiary colors are made from mixing a primary and secondary color together. On the RGB color wheel&sbquo; these colors would include teal&sbquo; violet&sbquo; and magenta. 
		<h3>Color Temperature</h3>
		<p>Colors can be either warm or cool. The way colors are placed on the color wheel also indicate if they are a warm or a cool color. Warm colors are on 
		one side of the color wheel while cool colors are on the other side. As you can see below&sbquo; warm colors include red&sbquo; orange and yellow&sbquo; and cool 
		colors include green&sbquo; blue&sbquo; and purple. </p>

		<h3>Color Schemes</h3>
		<p>Color Schemes are color combinations that look appealing together. Below are the seven main color schemes.

		<h3>Tints&sbquo; Shades&sbquo; and  tones</h3>
		<ul class="reglist">
			<li>Tint: How much white is in the color</li>
			<li>Shade: How much black is in the color</li>
			<li>Tone: How much grey is in the color </li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Saturation and Hue</h3>
		<h4>Hue</h4>
		<p>Hue is the dominant color family of a color. It is basically just pure color&sbquo; and what we use the color wheel to choose. For example a hue would 
		be green&sbquo; without any shade&sbquo; tone&sbquo; or tint.</p>
		<h4>Saturation</h4>
		<p>Saturation is essentially the intensity of a color. A color that has no saturation would be either black&sbquo; grey&sbquo; or white. Below is 
		an example of different saturations. They are 2 of the same images&sbquo; only the right one is more saturated than the left.</p>
